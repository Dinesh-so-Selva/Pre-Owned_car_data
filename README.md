### Files Included

- **F1-car_dataset_india_rawdata.csv** : Raw dataset file.
- **F2-cars_python.ipynb** : Python notebook for data cleaning and analysis.
- **F3-cars_sql.sql** : SQL queries for data analysis.
- **F4-cars_powerbi.pbix** : Power BI dashboard for interactive visualization.

---

### Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (optional, for quick data viewing)

### Project Workflow

#### 1. Data Collection

- **Source**: Pre-collected Indian car dataset containing features like brand, model, price, fuel type, and more.

#### 2. Data Cleaning (Python)

- Handled missing values.
- Corrected inconsistent data entries.
- Converted data types where necessary.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

- Univariate analysis (brand distribution, fuel type, transmission type).
- Bivariate analysis (price vs brand, fuel type vs price).
- Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

#### 4. SQL Analysis

- Imported the cleaned data into a SQL database.
- Executed SQL queries to find:
  - Top car brands by count.
  - Average car price based on fuel type.
  - Cars with maximum and minimum prices.
  - Distribution by transmission type.

#### 5. Interactive Visualization (Power BI)

- Developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI to:
  - Visualize car brand popularity.
  - Analyze price distribution across fuel types and transmission types.
  - Explore car segment trends (SUVs, Sedans, Hatchbacks).

### Key Insights

#### Data Cleaning

- Null values mainly in columns related to engine and mileage.
- Standardization of brand names and fuel types was required.

#### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Petrol cars dominate the dataset.
- Manual transmission is more common than automatic in the sample.
- SUV and Hatchback are the most popular car types.

#### SQL Analysis

- **Maruti** and **Hyundai** are the most common brands.
- Diesel vehicles generally have a slightly higher average price.
- Automatic cars are priced higher on average compared to manual.

#### Power BI Dashboard

- Offered intuitive filters for brand, price, fuel type, and transmission.
- Highlighted average pricing trends across different car types.
- Enhanced storytelling through dynamic visualizations.
